Work in progress on a plugin to dynamically allocate labels in order
to allow for throttling the number of concurrent builds of a project
allowed to run on a given node at one time.

Category Reader/Writer locks
----------------------------
Global reader/writer locks are implemented for categories, but not per
node reader/writer locks.  To use global locks, configure a job to
throttle on the category as a reader or a writer, instead of normal.

If a job starts that is a reader on a category and any writers on that
category are running on any node, then it will block until no writer
is running on any node.  If a job starts as a writer on a category and
any writers *or* readers on that category are running, then it will
block.  Note that it's possible for readers to starve out writers.
