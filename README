Work in progress on a plugin to dynamically allocate labels in order
to allow for throttling the number of concurrent builds of a project
allowed to run on a given node at one time.

Category Reader/Writer locks
----------------------------
Global reader/writer locks are implemented for categories, but not per
node reader/writer locks.  To use them, configure a job to throttle on
the category as a reader or a writer.

If a job starts that is a reader on a category and any writers on that
category are running on any node, then it will block until no writer
is running on that node.  If a job starts as as a writer a category
and and any writers *or* readers on that category are running, then it
will block.  Note that it's possible for readers to starve out
writers.
